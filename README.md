# Tasker

## Product Description

This application is a task manager which allows one user to add, view, modify and remove tasks in the form of cards.

Simply click the 'New' button to usher in an input box, add text and click the 'Submit' button to create a new task. All existing tasks will be presented automatically with their contents kept up-to-date at all times.

Tasks can have their text changed by clicking on the text, typing or deleting as desired and pressing the 'Enter' key. Tasks can have their status as complete or incomplete toggled by checking the checkbox at the right of each card.

After toggling a task as complete, a delete button will appear next to the checkbox of the task's card which will erase the task once clicked.
